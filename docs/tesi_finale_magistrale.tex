\section*{Problem definition and motivation}
This section presents the theoretical formulation of the cooperative search
problem, including the environment model, the vehicle dynamics
model, the states and action space involved.
\subsection*{Environment}
In our proposed collaborative task, the Environment E consists of a portion of space equals to $E_x x E_y$ meters. There are N agents (where $N\le6$) moving at the same discrete time synchronously, sending to the ground station at each time step $t$ the following information:
$$ s_i(t) = (\bar{g_{i}}(t),F_{i,t},C_{i,t})$$
where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\bar{g_{i}}(t) = (x_{i,t},y_{i,t},z_{i,t})$, $\bar{g_{i}}(t)$ are the GPS simulated coordinates at time t for drone i
	
	\item $(F_{i,t}){n\times m} = $ 
	$\begin{bmatrix}
		p_{0,0} & ... & p_{0,m-1} \\ ... & ... & ... \\ p_{n-1,0} & ... & p_{n-1,m-1} 
	\end{bmatrix}
	$, $F_{i,t} $ is an image taken by drone i at time t, p is a pixel
	
	\item $(C_{i,t})_{N\times N} = $ 
	$\begin{bmatrix}
	c_{0,0} & ... & c_{0,N-1} \\ ... & ... & ... \\ c_{N-1,0} & ... & c_{N-1,N-1} 
	\end{bmatrix}
	$,\\ \\
	 $C_{i,t} $ is the communication matrix associated to instant t for drone i.\\
	$(c_{u,v})_{u,v=0,..,N-1} = \begin{cases} 0 \mbox{ (false)}, & \mbox{if } drone_{u,v} \mbox{ is outside coverage areaof drone in} \\ 1 \mbox{ (true)}, & \mbox{otherwise}
	\end{cases}$
\end{itemize}

 The vehicles are assumed to be equipped with reliable
communication capabilities so that they can exchange sensing information among the group without any error or delay.
The objective of UAVs is to explore the environment cooperatively and to gather information till the target (or multiple targets) is identified and localized.

\subsection*{Action space for simplified Aerial Vehicle}
At initial timestep $t=0$ each UAV is laying on the ground, positioned inside the respective takeoff zone. Each UAV has associated a takeoff zone which is a rectangular area, not bordering with the others, used to delimit the random initial position for the UAV inside of it.
% TODO specificare meglio %
At the next time steps each drone moves to the nearest point belonging to the line representing the street to be patrolled.
When a UAV is positioned over the street it start flying above it, so at each time step it moves and take pictures of the street. In this phase drones can move in 8 directions in order to follow the path of the street in both direction of travel. So the action space will be: 
$$ A = \{ 1 \mbox{ (up), }
2 \mbox{ (up-right), }
3 \mbox{ (right), } 
4 \mbox{ (down-right), }
5\mbox{ (down), }
6 \mbox{ (down-left), }
7 \mbox{ (left), } 
8 \mbox{ (up-left) }
\}$$
Each $a \in A$ has specific velocity and angles of motion designed to respect maneuverability constraints.

\subsection*{States and observations}
The already mentioned state $s_i(t) \in S$ is vehicle state vector for vehicle $i^{th}$. This
information, in particular the first and last component ( $\bar{g_i}(t)$ and $C_{i,t}$) are used to guide the search to certain areas of the
environment and can be consistently updated using sensor information about the environment. The communication matrix $C_{i,t}$ is used to prevent eventual collision and improve cooperation avoiding multiple exploration of the same places in a limited range of time.

\chapter{Style features of \textsf{sapthesis}}

In this chapter I will discuss my stylistic choices of \textsf{sapthesis}.
I will show the page layout geometry and I will describe the page style.

\section{Page layout}

The page is fixed at the dimensions of an A4 paper, therefore you have to print your thesis on A4 paper to obtain the best results. The font dimension is fixed at 11\, pt. The text column and the margins are chosen to fill to the best an A4 paper while keeping a reasonable line length (396\, pt) for a good readability. The text height and the text width are in golden ratio (\textasciitilde 1.6180) as well as the outer and inner margins in a two-side document after binding margin removal. Also the top margin (excluding the header) and bottom margin are in the golden ratio. In Fig.~\ref{layout} a sketch of the \textsf{sapthesis} page layout is shown.

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{picture}
\caption{Page layout scheme of \textsf{sapthesis class} using a zero binding margin.}
\label{layout}
\end{figure}


\section{Page style}

The captions have a smaller font respect to the text and the label is in boldface. The appearance of the margin notes has been improved.
They have the same font dimension of the footnotes and are typed in italics.
Moreover I defined a new command to typeset margin note aligned to the left on the right page and vice versa on the left page.
Notice that if a binding margin greater than 1.5\, cm is used, the dimensions of the margin notes become too small and very ugly.
Do not use them in this case.

The mathematical objects, figures and tables are numbered within the chapters (e.g. 1.1, 1.2,\ldots for the first chapter, 2.1, 2.2 for the second one and so on\ldots). See for example the number of this simple equation
\begin{equation}
x_{1,2}=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{equation}


The title page is automatically composed when the \texttt{\bs maketitle} command is given.
The parameters needed for the title page, author, title, etc\ldots , are supplied by dedicated commands explained in the next section.
Two copies of the university logo in \texttt{pdf} format, one for color printing and the other one for black and white printing, are supplied in the \textsf{sapthesis} package. They are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:largenenough}.

\end{figure}



\section{About figures and tables}

As regards the image formats, please use vector images as much as possible! Use jpg images only for photographs! pdf\LaTeX\ supports the pdf, jpg and png formats.

A very simple table is show in Tab.~\ref{tab:letters}. Remember to typeset
always the table caption above the table. Do not use vertical lines.

\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{lcc}

\midrule

\appendix
\chapter{Special commands provided by \textsf{sapthesis}}

\textsf{Sapthesis} provides some special commands, particularly useful for scientific works. You can use for example the roman shape, instead of the italic, for the imaginary unit (\texttt{\bs iu}) and Napier's number (\texttt{\bs eu}):
\begin{equation}
\eu^{\iu\pi}+1=0
\end{equation}

There are also two commands to speed up the writing of derivatives. In the following example we have used the commands \texttt{\bs der} and \texttt{\bs pder}):
\begin{equation}
\der{f}{x} \qquad \pder{f}{*{2}{y}}
\end{equation}


\textsf{Sapthesis} provides also 4 commands to improve the writing of subscripts, \texttt{\bs rb} and \texttt{\bs tb}, and superscripts, \texttt{\bs rp} and \texttt{\bs tp}. Two of these commands, \texttt{\bs rb} and \texttt{\bs rp}, can be used both in text and in math mode and compose their argument in roman. The other two, \texttt{\bs tb} and \texttt{\bs tp}, can be used only in text mode and compose their argument as are. Here it is an usage example of \texttt{\bs rb} and \texttt{\bs rp}:
\[
a_b \neq a\rb{b}\qquad a^b \neq a\rp{b}
\]
And here it is an usage example of \texttt{\bs tb}: \emph{Cu\tb{It} indicates copper bought in Italy}. And a usage example of \texttt{\bs ts}: \emph{Cher G\tp{le} Napol\'eon}.


Then several commands for the correct typesetting of unit of measurements are provided. For example the command \texttt{\bs un} typesets its argument in roman and leaves a thin space between the number and the unit: $25\un{m}$, $3.5\un{m/s}$. Other commands are: (\texttt{\bs g}) 45\g, (\texttt{\bs C}) 30\,\C, (\texttt{\bs A}) 12\,\A, (\texttt{\bs micro}) 40\,\micro m, (\texttt{\bs ohm}) 27\,\ohm. 

We have also \texttt{\bs x} as abbreviation of \texttt{\bs times}: \texttt{\$7 \bs x 10\^{}5\$} gives $7 \x 10^5$. Then \texttt{\bs di} is the differential symbol which automatically insert the correct spacing.
\[
\int x \di x
\]

Finally we have defined the color \textsf{sapred} which is the official color
of Sapienza -- University of Rome. It is defined as RGB(130,36,51). \textcolor{sapred}{This text is written with the color \textsf{sapred}.}

In the following dummy text you can observe the usage of \texttt{\bs mnote} command which typesets fancy margin notes.
